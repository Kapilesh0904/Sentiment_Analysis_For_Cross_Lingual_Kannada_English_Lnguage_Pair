# Sentiment_Analysis_For_Cross_Lingual_Kannada_English

Sentiment analysis involves analyzing text to identify the emotion behind it and has numerous applications. Kannada is a Dravidian language spoken in India that presents a challenge to monolingual NLP models due to the nature of its script and limited language technology resources, but the Kannada-English code-mixed dataset from the Dravidian-CodeMix-FIRE 2021 shared task provides an opportunity for sentiment analysis research. The dataset was collected and text processing has been carried out at different levels for sentiment analysis. Text cleaning, transliteration, spell check, and translation to monolingual Kannada are some of the stages involved. Different models are built and evaluated based on performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
